Real-Time Independent Vector Analysis C++ library
===
IVA library is based on Eigen3 and Google ProtoBuf, and compiled in cmake, so install Eigen3, ProtoBuf, CMake, before using it.<br>

Install the dependencies on Ubuntu
----
```shell
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libeigen3-dev
```


Install the dependencies libraries on MacOS
----
```shell
brew install protobuf eigen 
```


Usage of this library
----
```shell
cd /path/to/the/library
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/iva
```
About the config folder

there are two files, `data.prototxt` and `iva.prototxt`<br>

**iva.prototxt**
this file contains nine parameters which will be used in the IVA algorithm. 
**data.prototxt**
