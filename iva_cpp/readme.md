Real-Time Independent Vector Analysis C++ library
===
IVA library is based on Eigen3 and Google ProtoBuf, and compiled in cmake, so install Eigen3, ProtoBuf, CMake, before using it.<br>

Install the dependencies on Ubuntu
----
```shell
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libeigen3-dev cmake
```


Install the dependencies libraries on MacOS
----
```shell
brew install protobuf eigen cmake
```


Usage of this library
----
```shell
cd /path/to/the/library
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
About the config folder
------
there are two files, `data.prototxt` and `iva.prototxt`<br>

**iva.prototxt**
this file contains nine parameters which will be used in the IVA algorithm. <br>
**data.prototxt**
this file contains the reverberation mixed signals, which is generated by `MATLAB`.<br>
**data.prototxt.csv**
after the code finishing runing, this file, which contain the signals unmixed, will be generated.<br>
this file can be drag into matlab and can be named like source_estimate1, source_estimate2, source_estimate3...<br>
then sound them as follow

```matlab
sound(source_estimate1/max(abs(source_estimate1)),sample_rate) %where sample_rate is the sample rate of the source signal.
```

Config the number of audio sources 
------
To compile right number of sources library, SOURCE_NUM definition should be right configured.<br>
SOURCE_NUM is configured in `CMakeLists.txt`.
For example, if number of sources the **first line** of `CMakeLists.txt` should be.
```bash
ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DSOURCE_NUM=2)
```
